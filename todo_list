For 22/10/2016

For correctness of program:

Need to extend search such that it tries combination for 2 words first
and continues with more words that it is combining.

Currently its only running combinations of 3 words.
If the anagram was not a combination of 3 words the program would not find it currently.

For optimization of program:

Setup for the program to run in multiple processes.
Find way to setup computation to use numpy arrays.
