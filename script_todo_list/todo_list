-----For correctness of program------

Need to extend search such that it tries combination for 2 words first
and continues with more words that it is combining.

Currently its only running combinations of 3 words.
If the anagram was not a combination of 3 words the program would not find it currently.

-----For optimization of program------

Make numpy binary search run on multiple cores.

-----For testing of the program------

-High priority-
Write test for search_algorithms currently only 30% is covered

Test on parts of file_writer, file_reader, wordlist_cleaner missing.


-----Clean up program-------

Go though program, make sure methods makes sense in that place.
