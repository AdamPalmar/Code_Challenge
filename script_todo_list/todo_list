-----For correctness of program------

Need to extend search such that it tries combination for 2 words first
and continues with more words that it is combining.

Currently its only running combinations of 3 words.
If the anagram was not a combination of 3 words the program would not find it currently.

-----For optimization of program------

Find way to setup computation to use numpy arrays.

Tree structure of the prime products combinations that would
sum to the wanted product sum.

Find a way to do early stopping making it
possible to stop looping over not viable combination.
(Partialy done with binary search)



-----For testing of the program------

Test on parts of file_writer, file_reader, wordlist_cleaner missing.
