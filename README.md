# Anagram Solver
Initial thoughts
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram.
An anagram is made by rearranging the letters of a word or sentence such that a new word or phrase is created.

My initial thoughts.
This problem seems like i would could be solved with a dynamic programming approch.
Possibly also in parallel because there is no dependencies between each word.
Having a mechanism to stop early in a word search would also seem like a good idea to avoid wasting computation.
